# motoWeather
a quick script to check if we should commute to work by bike
Enter the lattitude and longitude of points along your route
Enter your commute times (eg, I'm flexible, and willing to commute to work anywhere between 8-10am (i'd enter 8,9), and come home anywhere between 4 and 7 (16,17,18)
make an openweathermap.org account (free subscription should do!), and enter your api key
consider what conditions you're willing to commute in: skip it when it's too cold? add "temp" to "minimums". okay with a light drizzle, but want to avoid the downpour? add "rain.1h" to "maximums"
